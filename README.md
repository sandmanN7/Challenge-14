# Challenge-14 Bike-Sharing Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to show a variety of data regarding the users of the bike-sharing app, including most common times of use for the bikes, the gender and customer type breakdown and the usage by day, in order to help convince other cities that bike-sharing can work there as well.

## Results

This is the gender breakdown of the total number of rides recorded in August. Roughly two-thirds of riders are male, one-fourth are female, and the rest are unknown, but likely breakdown similarly.

This shows the number of bikes being used at each hour per day. Number of bikes being used rises at 5am, rises until 8am, then declines until 10am. After 10am, the number gradually rises until 5pm, from which it steadily declines again consistently.

This shows the most popular usage time by gender. While there are different shades due to a higher number of male users, the peak usage time is both roughly the same for both male and female users.

This breaks down the usage by gender and type of user. Both male and female subscribers tend to have a higher number of bike uses than do the customers of each respective gender. Subscribers tend to use bike-sharing more during the week while customers are more likely to make trips during the weekends, though there are still more uses from subscribes during weekends as well.
