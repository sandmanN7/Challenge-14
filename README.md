## Objective
The objective of this project is to show a variety of data regarding the users of the bike-sharing app, including most common times of use for the bikes, the gender and customer type breakdown and the usage by day, in order to help convince other cities that bike-sharing can work there as well.

## Results

This shows how long a users will use a bike. Most bike trips tend to be under an hour.

This shows the breakdown of checkout times by gender. Both male and female users tend to use bikes under an hour, though males tend to use them slightly longer than females.

This is the gender breakdown of the total number of rides recorded in August. Roughly two-thirds of riders are male, one-fourth are female, and the rest are unknown, but likely breakdown similarly.

This shows the number of bikes being used at each hour per day. Number of bikes being used rises at 5am, rises until 8am, then declines until 10am. After 10am, the number gradually rises until 5pm, from which it steadily declines again consistently.

Shows most popular usage times with an emphasis on weekdays. Most popular times are 6am-10am and 4pm-8pm on weekdays

This shows the most popular usage time by gender. While there are different shades due to a higher number of male users, the peak usage time is both roughly the same for both male and female users.

This breaks down the usage by gender and type of user. Both male and female subscribers tend to have a higher number of bike uses than do the customers of each respective gender. Subscribers tend to use bike-sharing more during the week while customers are more likely to make trips during the weekends, though there are still more uses from subscribes during weekends as well.

## Summary
Overall, while the majority users are male, both males and females tend to use bike-sharing around the same approximate times, namely during largely "rush hour" times of 6am-10am and 4pm-8pm on weekdays, with peak usage being in between these ranges and with trips being under an hour. Two recommended future visualizations that would be recommended are one that includes the number of users and weather, and one that includes the average distance per trip. In this way, one could have a better estimation of the effect of weather and how far users are willing to bike.
